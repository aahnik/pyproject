# Contributing Guidelines

 **ðŸ‘‹ It's great to see you here !**

Thanks a lot for thinking about contributing code to this project.

> If you are a beginner, make sure you know all the essential concepts of [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en).
>
> Knowledge of the different tools used for packaging, testing and documentation is expected, besides knowing [Python](https://python.org).

## Rules

- Please create an issue first (bug report or feature request), and discuss the changes.
- In the issue,mention that you are willing to contribute code.
- Wait for the maintainers to assign you for the issue.
- Once you are assinged, create a fork, and a make fresh branch to start working.
- The name of the branch should be `<github-username>-<feature-or-bug-name>`.
- For example, if your github user name is [`aahnik`](https://github.com/aahnik),

  your branch (that you submit for PR), should be created as `aahnik-new-feature` (the word `new-feature` should be replaced with a short name for the issue you are working on).
- You should submit PRs to the `main` branch of this project.
- You must thoroughly test your changes. Preferably write new tests.
- PR will not be merged until all tests pass.


## General Best Practices

- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Commit frequently with a collection of closely related changes.
- Submit small patches.
- Make a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) if your changes are not yet ready to merge.
- Comment and explain what you are doing.
- Follow the code style, (dont worry, it will be enforced).
- Write tests, if you made a new feature.
- Run the tests locally before you push changes to GitHub.
